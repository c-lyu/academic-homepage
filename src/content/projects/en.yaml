  dateRange: "2025"
  title: "PopGen - Data-driven Synthetic Population Generation"
  collaboration: "Technical University of Munich & Technical University of Denmark"
  description: "Improving the fidelity and credibility of synthetic population for transport simulation models. Proposed a tabular generative model based on flow matching tailored for synthetic population, featuring explicit feature dependency modelling with graph neural network & controlled generation constrained by input marginals."
