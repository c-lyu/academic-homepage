Hi! I am a research associate and Ph.D. candidate at the Chair of Transportation Systems Engineering at Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I have been working since November 2021.

My research focuses on machine learning for transportation systems, with emphasis on transportation demand modeling and emerging mobility solutions. I am passionate about advancing intelligent transportation systems through innovative machine learning approaches. In particular, I develop generative models and data imputation techniques to address various data challenges in modern transportation systems.
